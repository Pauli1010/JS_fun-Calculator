Above we have just one project to have fun with Vanilla JS

We have a simple calculator that gets two digits.
When acton is forbidden (like dividing by 0) the message is returned and result input is cleared.

On the second bar we can choose which actions we want to use.

On third bar we have the history of taken actions.

Plain and simple ^_^
